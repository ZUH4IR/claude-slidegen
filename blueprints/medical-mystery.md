# Medical Mystery Blueprint

## Structure Overview
Create compelling medical drama stories that hook viewers with mysterious symptoms, misdiagnoses, and surprising revelations. Always maintain medical plausibility.

## Variables
- {{symptom_start}}: Initial concerning symptom
- {{misdiagnosis}}: What doctors initially thought
- {{real_condition}}: The actual diagnosis
- {{discovery_moment}}: How truth was revealed

## Slide 1: Symptom Hook
- Start with alarming symptom: "Woke up and {{symptom_start}}"
- Time pressure: "Getting worse by the hour"
- Authority failure: "Doctor said it was just..."
- Maximum concern generation

## Slide 2: Escalation
- Additional symptoms emerge
- Show medical dismissal: "They said I was overreacting"
- Build fear: "Started affecting my {{body_function}}"
- Create medical anxiety

## Slide 3: Crisis Point
- Peak medical drama
- Near-miss or emergency moment
- Reveal the real diagnosis
- "Turns out I had {{real_condition}}"

## Slide 4: Recovery Journey
- Show the treatment path
- Validate viewer's medical anxiety
- "If I hadn't insisted on {{action}}..."
- Begin product transition

## Slide 5: Health Solution
- "{{client_name}} helps me manage my {{health_aspect}}"
- Empowerment through product
- Preventive message
- Health-focused CTA

## Medical Rage Triggers
1. "Doctors didn't believe me until..."
2. "Told it was all in my head, but..."
3. "Simple test would have caught it..."
4. "Years of suffering because..."

## Symptom Starters
- Sudden onset: vision, numbness, pain
- Gradual: fatigue, weight change, mood
- Episodic: fainting, tremors, confusion
- Visible: rashes, swelling, discoloration

## Comment Drivers
- "What were your symptoms?"
- "Same thing happened to me!"
- "Which doctor/hospital?"
- "How long did diagnosis take?"
- "Sue them!"

## Ethical Guidelines
- No terminal illness scares
- Avoid rare genetic conditions
- No pregnancy loss stories
