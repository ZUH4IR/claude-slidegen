# Relationship Shock Blueprint

## Structure Overview
Maximize engagement through relationship drama and unexpected revelations. Build from normal relationship to shocking discovery to empowered resolution.

## Variables
- {{partner_type}}: Relationship status (BF, GF, husband, wife, partner)
- {{duration}}: Length of relationship
- {{discovery_item}}: What was found (phone, messages, receipts)
- {{shock_revelation}}: The actual secret

## Slide 1: False Security
- Establish normalcy: "My {{partner_type}} of {{duration}}"
- Positive trait mention
- Discovery tease: "Then I found their {{discovery_item}}"
- Maximum curiosity gap

## Slide 2: Investigation Build
- Detail the discovery process
- Build tension: "What I saw made no sense"
- Create theories in reader's mind
- "I had to know more..."

## Slide 3: The Bomb Drop
- Reveal the shocking truth
- Maximum emotional whiplash
- Specific enough to be believable
- Vague enough for projection

## Slide 4: Emotional Processing
- Show the impact
- Relatable emotional response
- Begin strength narrative
- "That's when I decided..."

## Slide 5: Empowered Resolution
- "{{client_name}} gave me the {{benefit}}"
- Transformation narrative
- New life glimpse
- Strong CTA

## High-Engagement Starters
1. "Found my {{partner_type}}'s secret {{item}}..."
2. "My {{partner_type}} had a whole other {{shocking_thing}}..."
3. "After {{duration}}, discovered my {{partner_type}} was..."
4. "Caught my {{partner_type}} red-handed..."

## Psychological Triggers

## Engagement Amplifiers
