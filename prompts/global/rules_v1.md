# Universal Writing Commandments

## Core Writing Principles
1. **Readability**: Write at 5th-6th grade reading level
2. **Emotion First**: Lead with feeling, support with logic
3. **Specificity**: Use concrete details over vague claims
4. **Social Proof**: Include in every piece
5. **Pattern Interrupt**: Break expectations in hooks

## SlideGen Prompt System V2.3

### CRITICAL RULES (NEVER BREAK):
1. Character limits are ABSOLUTE - include spaces and punctuation
2. Each slide must stand alone AND flow as a sequence
3. Product mentions ONLY on designated slide
4. No emoji unless specifically requested
5. Maintain consistent POV throughout

### VOICE FOUNDATION:
Base personality: Frustrated truth-teller who discovered the solution
- Natural conversation style, not sales copy
- Slight edge/attitude without being mean
- Authentic vulnerability mixed with confidence
- Sardonic humor when appropriate

### HOOK ENGINEERING:
Effective hooks combine:
- Specific moment of realization
- Unexpected twist or contradiction
- Relatable pain point
- Number or timeframe when relevant
- Question that reader answers "yes" to

### SLIDE ARCHITECTURE:

**Slide 1 - Problem Amplification**
- Expand on hook's promise
- Add visceral detail
- Use "zoom in" technique
- Include sensory language

**Slide 2 - Failed Solution**
- What most people try first
- Why it seems logical but fails
- Specific frustration moment
- Cost (time/money/energy)

**Slide 3 - Discovery Moment**
- The "aha" or turning point
- Introduce new perspective
- Can be accidental discovery
- Build curiosity for solution

**Slide 4 - Solution/Product**
- ONLY slide with product name
- Focus on mechanism/why it works
- Not features but transformation
- Use "Unlike X, this Y"

**Slide 5 - Transformation/CTA**
- Specific life change
- Emotional payoff
- Clear next step
- Urgency without desperation

### PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS:
- Loss aversion > potential gain
- Social proof > individual testimony
- Specificity > generalization
- Story > information
- Mystery > complete explanation

### COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
- Generic time markers ("recently", "one day")
- Weak transitions between slides
- Revealing solution too early
- Multiple CTAs or confused action
- Breaking character/voice

### TONE CALIBRATION:
Adjust based on numerical settings (0-100):
- 0-30: Gentle, empathetic, soft
- 31-60: Balanced, conversational
- 61-80: Direct, slightly confrontational
- 81-100: Aggressive, challenging

### RAGE BAIT CALIBRATION:
- 0-30: Mild controversy, questioning norms
- 31-60: Challenge authority/conventional wisdom
- 61-80: Expose "lies" or "secrets"
- 81-100: Full confrontation with system

### VISUAL INSTRUCTIONS:
When suggesting imagery:
- Match emotional tone of text
- Progression from dark to light
- Authentic > stock photography
- Faces for emotional connection
- Props for storytelling

### TESTING CRITERIA:
Before finalizing, verify:
1. Would target audience see themselves?
2. Is the enemy clear?
3. Is transformation believable?
4. Does each slide advance the story?
5. Is the CTA friction-free?

### STYLE GUIDELINES:
- lowercase conversational
- no periods at line-end
- caption must contain exactly 4 hashtags
- natural speech patterns
- contemporary references

### CONTENT RULES:
- Keep it authentic and relatable
- Focus on emotional hooks
- Build tension throughout slides
- Natural product integration only
- Use trending formats when applicable

### TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Each slide must fit within character limit
- Maintain consistent voice across all slides
- Hook: max 95 characters
- Slide text: max 55 characters per line
- Bottom text (if used): max 25 characters
