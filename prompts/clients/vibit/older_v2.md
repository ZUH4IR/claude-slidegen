# Vibit Older Campaign Rules

## Campaign-Specific Voice
Empathetic yet confrontational about ageist medical dismissal. Mix frustration with hope.

## Key Messaging Points
- Doctors dismissing foot pain as "just getting older"
- The difference between normal aging and treatable conditions
- Taking control of your foot health
- Not accepting pain as inevitable

## Tone Adjustments
- More medical terminology awareness
- Reference life milestones (grandkids, retirement activities)
- Acknowledge past failed treatments
- Balance skepticism with hope

## Specific Hooks That Work
- "My doctor said it's just arthritis..."
- "I thought foot pain was normal after 50..."
- "They told me to just lose weight..."
- "I was about to give up walking..."

## Visual Strategy
- Show active older adults
- Before/after mobility improvements
- Relatable home settings
- Avoid overly clinical imagery
