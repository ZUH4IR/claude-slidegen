## Campaign-Specific Voice
Competitive and performance-driven. Frustrated with temporary fixes.

## Key Messaging Points
- Orthotics holding you back from peak performance
- The hidden cost of compensating for foot problems
- Professional athletes' secret weapon
- Stop treating symptoms, fix the root cause

## Tone Adjustments
- Use sports and performance language
- Reference specific activities (running, CrossFit, hiking)
- Emphasize speed of results
- Challenge "tough it out" mentality

## Specific Hooks That Work
- "My PT kept taping my feet..."
- "I was spending $200/month on insoles..."
- "Other runners kept passing me..."
- "I thought pain was part of training..."

## Visual Strategy
- Athletic activities and sports
- Dynamic movement shots
- Performance metrics/improvements
- Gear comparisons (old orthotics vs Vibit)
