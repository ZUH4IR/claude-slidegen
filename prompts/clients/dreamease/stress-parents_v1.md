# Stress Parents Campaign

## Campaign Psychology
Parents are exhausted, guilty, and desperate for rest. They've tried everything and feel like failures. We validate their struggle and offer hope.

## Rage Bait Angles
- Partner sleeping while you're up with kids
- Judgmental in-laws about parenting
- Mom guilt about needing rest
- Work-life balance impossibility
- "You should sleep when baby sleeps" rage

## Story Patterns

### The 3AM Breakdown
- Hook: "It's 3AM and {{child_action}} again"
- Build: Exhaustion details, partner oblivious
- Peak: Breaking point moment
- Resolution: "Finally tried {{client_name}}"
- CTA: "Now I can be the parent I want to be"

### The Judgment Story
- Hook: "MIL said I looked tired. I snapped."
- Build: Weeks of no sleep, criticism building
- Peak: Confrontation or breakdown
- Resolution: "{{client_name}} = my sanity saver"
- CTA: "Stop suffering in silence"

## Proven Hooks
1. "Haven't slept more than 3 hours since..."
2. "My partner sleeps through everything while I..."
3. "MIL: 'You look exhausted.' Me: 'Thanks, I know.'"
4. "Kid woke up 5 times. Partner: 'I didn't hear anything.'"

## Comment Triggers
- "How old are your kids?"
- "Single parent here, I feel this"
- "Why doesn't partner help?"
- "This is why I'm child-free"
- "Have you tried [useless advice]?"

## Product Integration
Natural, desperate moment: "Ordered {{client_name}} at 3AM during another sleepless night. Game changer."
