# Relationship Anxiety Campaign

## Campaign Psychology
Relationship uncertainty creates a vicious cycle: anxiety prevents sleep, lack of sleep increases anxiety. We validate their fears while offering relief.

## Rage Bait Angles
- Partner's suspicious behavior
- Late night phone usage
- Changed passwords
- "Working late" too often
- Friends knowing something you don't

## Story Patterns

### The Phone Mystery
- Hook: "Partner guards their phone like Fort Knox"
- Build: Strange behavior patterns, anxiety building
- Peak: Can't sleep wondering what they're hiding
- Resolution: "{{client_name}} helps me rest despite the stress"
- CTA: "Can't control them, but I can control my sleep"

### The Overthinking Spiral
- Hook: "They said 'we need to talk' then fell asleep"
- Build: Hours of catastrophizing
- Peak: 4AM anxiety attack
- Resolution: "{{client_name}} calms my racing mind"
- CTA: "Stop letting anxiety steal your sleep"

## High-Engagement Hooks
1. "Partner's been 'working late' for weeks..."
2. "They changed their phone password. I can't sleep."
3. "Saw a text preview that made my stomach drop"
4. "Their 'friend' knows something I don't"
5. "They sleep fine. I'm up all night wondering."

## Comment Triggers
- "Trust your gut!"
- "This happened to me, they were cheating"
- "Maybe it's nothing?"
- "Why not just ask?"
- "I could never sleep either"

## Product Integration
Authentic desperation: "Ordered {{client_name}} because the anxiety was killing me. At least now I can sleep while I figure out what to do."
